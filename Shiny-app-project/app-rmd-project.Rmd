## Predicting MPG from the mtcars dataset

This project goal is to create a  Shiny app that predicts the miles per gallon (mpg) from the mtcars dataset based on user-selected predictors. 

This is how the dataset looks like

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```
## Fitting data to a linear model using lm

Output is mpg and predictors are disp, hp, and wt

```{r}
model <- lm(mpg ~ disp + hp + wt, data = mtcars)
summary(model)
```
